\chapter{Arbitrary action model logic}\label{aaml}

In this chapter we introduce the arbitrary action model logic (\logicAaml{}) and consider the logic in greater detail in the settings of \classK{}, \classKFF{}, and \classS{}.
\logicAaml{} extends the action model logic with quantifiers that denote either that every action model results in a statement becoming true or that some action model results in a statement becoming true.
This is similar to how \logicApal{} extends public announcement logic.
The main results of this chapter are to show that the action model quantifiers of \logicAaml{} are equivalent to the refinement quantifiers of \logicRml{} in the settings of \classK{}, \classKFF{}, and \classS{}.
As a consequence, most of the results for \logicRml{} from the previous chapters also hold in \logicAaml{} in these settings.
We show the equivalence by showing that if there exists a refinement where a given formula is satisfied then we can construct a finite action model that results in that formula being satisfied.
This equivalence further justifies our interpretation of refinement quantifiers as quantifiers for epistemic updates.
In Section~\ref{aaml-semantics} we introduce the syntax and semantics of \logicAaml{}.
In Section~\ref{aaml-k}, Section~\ref{aaml-kd45}, and Section~\ref{aaml-s5} we consider \logicAaml{} in greater detail in the settings of \classK{}, \classKFF{}, and \classS{} respectively.
In each setting we show that the action model quantifiers of \logicAaml{} are equivalent to the refinement quantifiers of \logicRml{}.
