Dynamic epistemic logics reason about knowledge and how knowledge changes in response to additional information, provided by events known as informative updates.
Previous work in dynamic epistemic logic has typically focussed on analysing how knowledge changes in response to specific informative updates.
In the present work we instead focus on analysing how knowledge changes in response to arbitrary informative updates.
This allows us to reason about the existence of informative updates that result in desired changes in knowledge, and synthesise such informative updates when they exist.

We consider extensions of epistemic logics with operators for quantifying over the results of various kinds of informative updates.
Arbitrary positive announcement logic quantifies over the results of public announcements of positive formulas.
Arbitrary action model logic quantifies over the results of executing action models, a very general form of informative update that subsumes public announcements.
Refinement modal logic quantifies over refinements, which have a partial correspondence with the results of action models, but are more general.
We investigate axiomatisations, expressivity, and model-checking, synthesis and decision procedures the resulting logics.
