\section{Arbitrary public announcement logic}\label{apal}

We recall definitions and results from the public announcement logic of Balbiani, et al~\cite{balbiani:2008}.

\begin{definition}[Language of arbitrary public announcement logic]
The {\em language of arbitrary public announcement logic}, \langApal{}, is inductively defined as:
$$
\phi ::= 
    \atomP \mid
    \lnot \phi \mid
    \phi \land \phi \mid
    \necessaryA \phi \mid
    \announceA{\phi} \phi \mid
    \allpas \phi
$$
where $\atomP \in \atoms$ and $\agentA \in \agents$.
\end{definition}

We use all of the standard abbreviations from public announcement logic, in addition to the abbreviation $\somepas \phi ::= \lnot \allpas \lnot \phi$.

The formula $\allpas \phi$ may be read as ``after any public announcement $\phi$ is true''.
The formula $\somepas \phi$ may be read as ``after some public announcement $\phi$ is true''.

We thus define the semantics of arbitrary public announcement logic. 

\begin{definition}[Semantics of arbitrary public announcement logic]
Let $\phi \in \langApal$ and let $\kPModelAndTuple{\kStateS} \in \classS$ be a pointed Kripke model.
The interpretation of the formula $\phi$ in the logic \logicApalS{} on the pointed Kripke model $\kPModel{\kStateS}$ is the same as its interpretation in public announcement logic, defined in Definition~\ref{pal-semantics}, with the additional inductive case:
$$
\begin{array}{lcl}
    \kPModel{\kStateS} \entails \allpas \psi & \text{ iff } & \text{for every } \psi \in \langMl : \kPModel{\kStateS} \entails \announceA{\psi} \phi
\end{array}
$$
\end{definition}

We only consider arbitrary public announcement logic in the setting of \classS{}, as in the source material~\cite{balbiani:2008} and as we did for public announcement logic.

\begin{example}\label{example-apal}
Consider the epistemic model $\kPModel{\kStateS}$ from Example~\ref{example-ml}.
In Example~\ref{example-pal} we showed that $\kPModel{\kStateS} \entails \announceE{\knowsA \atomP} \knowsB \atomP$ so it follows that $\kPModel{\kStateS} \entails \somepas \knowsB \atomP$.
\end{example}

\todo[inline]{Remarks}

\begin{proposition}
The logic \logicApalS{} is strictly more expressive than the logic \logicPalS{}.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
The logic \logicApalS{} is not compact.
\end{proposition}
