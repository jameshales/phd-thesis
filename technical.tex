\chapter{Technical preliminaries}\label{technical}

In this chapter we recall technical definitions and results used in the following chapters.
In Section~\ref{ml} we introduce modal logic, along with logical notation and terminology applicable to the other logics we will be working with.
All of the logics that we will be considering are modal logics or extensions of modal logics, and the definitions and results of this section will be used throughout the dissertation. 
In Section~\ref{pal} we introduce public announcement logic, a logic for reasoning about the effects of specific epistemic updates, then in Section~\ref{apal} we introduce arbitrary public announcement logic, a logic for also reasoning about the effects of arbitrary epistemic updates.
As a simple form of epistemic update we often use public announcements in examples and motivation, and we consider public announcements more closely in Chapter~\ref{papal} on arbitrary positive announcement logic.
In Section~\ref{aml} we introduce action model logic, a logic for reasoning about the effects of specific epistemic updates of a more general kind than just public announcements.
As a very general form of epistemic update we use action models in motivating the investigation of refinement modal logic in Chapter~\ref{rml}, and we consider action models more closely in Chapter~\ref{aaml} on arbitrary action model logic.
Finally in Section~\ref{mu} we introduce the modal $\mu$-calculus, a very expressive extension of modal logic that we use as a point of comparison for the expressivity of refinement modal logics in Chapter~\ref{rml}.
