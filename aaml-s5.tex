\begin{definition}[Axiomatisation \axiomAamlS{}]
The axiomatisation \axiomAamlS{} is a substitution schema consisting of the axioms and rules of \axiomAmlS{} and the axioms and rules of \axiomRmlS{}.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
The axiomatisation \axiomRmlS{} is sound and strongly complete with respect to the semantics of the logic \logicAamlS{}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Soundness of the axioms and rules from \axiomAmlS{} and \axiomRmlS{} follow from the same reasoning used to show that they are sound in \logicAmlS{} and \logicRmlS{} respectively.
Strong completeness follows from similar reasoning as in the proof of strong completeness of \axiomAamlK{} in Theorem~\ref{aaml-k-sound-complete}.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
The logic \logicAamlS{} is expressively equivalent to the logic \logicS{}.
\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}
The logic \logicAamlS{} is compact.
\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}
The satisfiability problem for the logic \logicAamlS{} is decidable.
\end{corollary}
