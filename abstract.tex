Dynamic epistemic logics reason about knowledge and how knowledge changes in response to additional information provided by events known as epistemic updates.
Previous work in dynamic epistemic logic has typically focussed on analysing how knowledge changes in response to specific epistemic updates.
In the present work we instead focus on analysing how knowledge changes in response to arbitrary epistemic updates, allowing us to pose questions about the existence of epistemic updates that result in desired changes in knowledge, and synthesise such epistemic updates when they do exist.

We consider extensions of epistemic logics with operators for quantifying over the results of epistemic updates.
Arbitrary positive announcement logic quantifies over the results of positive announcements, which are public announcements of positive formulas;
arbitrary action model logic quantifies over the results of action models, a very general form of epistemic update that subsumes public announcements; 
and refinement modal logic quantifies over refinements, which have a partial correspondence to the results of action models, but are more general.
We provide axiomatisations, synthesis and decision procedures, and expressivity results for these logics.
