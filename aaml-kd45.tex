\begin{definition}[Axiomatisation \axiomAamlKFF{}]
The axiomatisation \axiomAamlKFF{} is a substitution schema consisting of the axioms and rules of \axiomAmlKFF{} and the axioms and rules of \axiomRmlKFF{}.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
The axiomatisation \axiomRmlKFF{} is sound and strongly complete with respect to the semantics of the logic \logicAamlKFF{}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Soundness of the axioms and rules from \axiomAmlKFF{} and \axiomRmlKFF{} follow from the same reasoning used to show that they are sound in \logicAmlKFF{} and \logicRmlKFF{} respectively.
Strong completeness follows from similar reasoning as in the proof of strong completeness of \axiomAamlK{} in Theorem~\ref{aaml-k-sound-complete}.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
The logic \logicAamlKFF{} is expressively equivalent to the logic \logicKFF{}.
\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}
The logic \logicAamlKFF{} is compact.
\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}
The satisfiability problem for the logic \logicAamlKFF{} is decidable.
\end{corollary}
