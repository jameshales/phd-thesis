\chapter{Technical preliminaries}\label{technical}

In this chapter we recall technical definitions and results used in the following chapters.
In Section~\ref{ml} we introduce modal logic, along with logical notation and terminology applicable to the other logics we will be working with.
All of the logics that we will be considering are modal logics or extensions of modal logics, and the definitions and results of this section will be used throughout the following chapters. 
In Section~\ref{pal} we introduce public announcement logic, a logic for reasoning about the effects of specific epistemic updates, then in Section~\ref{apal} we introduce arbitrary public announcement logic, a logic for additionally quantifying over epistemic updates.
As a simple form of epistemic update we introduce public announcements as a gentle introduction to epistemic updates, and we often use public announcements in examples and motivation.
Likewise we introduce arbitrary public announcement logic as a gentle introduction to quantifying over epistemic updates, and in Chapter~\ref{aaml} we introduce the arbitrary action model logic, the semantics of which are inspired by the semantics of arbitrary public announcement logic.
Finally in Section~\ref{aml} we introduce action model logic, a logic for reasoning about the effects of specific epistemic updates of a more general kind than just public announcements.
As a very general form of epistemic update we use action models in motivating the investigation of refinement modal logic in Chapter~\ref{rml}, and we consider action models more closely in Chapter~\ref{aaml} on arbitrary action model logic.
