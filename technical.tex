\chapter{Technical preliminaries}\label{technical}

In this chapter we recall technical definitions and results used in the following chapters.
In Section~\ref{ml} we recall technical definitions and results for modal logic, along with logical notation and terminology applicable to the other logics we'll be working will.
All of the logics we'll be considering are modal logics or extensions of modal logics, and the definitions and results of this section will be used throughout the following chapters. 
In Section~\ref{aml} we we recall technical definitions and results for the action model logic of Baltag, Moss and Solecki~\cite{baltag:1998,baltag:2004}, a notable logic for reasoning about the effects of specific epistemic updates.
Action models represent a very general form of epistemic update, and we use action models in motivating the investigation of refinement modal logic in Chapter~\ref{rml}, and we consider action models more closely in Chapter~\ref{aaml} on arbitrary action model logic.
