Dynamic epistemic logics reason about the knowledge belonging to a collection of agents and how the agents' knowledge changes in response to epistemic updates, events that provide agents with additional information.
Previous work in dynamic epistemic logic, such as public announcement logic~\cite{plaza:1989,gerbrandy:1997} and action model logic~\cite{baltag:1998,baltag:2004}, introduced models for epistemic updates and logics for reasoning about the effects of specific epistemic updates using these models.
However many natural questions about epistemic updates cannot be expressed as questions about specific epistemic updates;
for example, given a desired change in knowledge we might ask ``Is there an epistemic update that results in the desired change in knowledge?'', and if there is we might also ask ``What is a specific epistemic update that results in the desired change in knowledge?''.
More recent work in dynamic epistemic logic, such as arbitrary public announcement logic~\cite{balbiani:2007} and group announcement logic~\cite{agotnes:2010}, has considered logics for quantifying over epistemic updates, in principle allowing us to answer such questions, although these particular logics are undecidable~\cite{french:2008,agotnes:2014}.

In the present work we introduce several decidable logics for quantifying over epistemic updates:
arbitrary action model logic, which quantifies over action models; and
refinement modal logic, which quantifies over refinements, which have a partial correspondence with the results of action models, but are more general.
We present sound and complete axiomatisations, expressivity results, and model-checking, synthesis and decision procedures for these logics in various modal settings..
